# pcie_accel_emu

This project implements a simple QEMU-based PCIe device driver and a userspace framework with AI accelerator functions. The system simulates custom AI accelerator hardware functions with DMA and IRQ capabilities, enabling efficient data transfer between host memory and the virtual device. The primary goal is to create a driver infrastructure for educational purposes.
